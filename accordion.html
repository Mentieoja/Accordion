              </h3>
                <p>A.M. Money offers loans to students who have excelled academically. We ask applicants to provide up-to-date information about their education and future employment.

Right now, we can provide financing to students who have the following:
- Juniors or Senior standing
- Above-average GPA 
- Attend an eligible school (list of eligible Illinois-based schools, contact us for schools outside of Illinois)
- US citizenship
- Pell-eligible or near Pell-eligible </p>

                Do you require students to make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) in order to receive the loan?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Yes, we ask the school to verify satisfactory academic progress during school certification. The school applies their individual criteria for SAP. In other words, we don’t define SAP, but we do ask the school to confirm that the student is making SAP according to each school’s definition.

                Do you offer income-based repayment plans?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Yes! We are the first private student lender to offer an income-based repayment option to our borrowers. If you cannot afford your standard monthly payment,  you may be eligible to adjust your payment based on your income. 

Our Income Based Repayment Option is different from the federal plan (which is a good thing!) Here are some of the differences:
- Our loans are not “forgiven” after a certain number of years.
- The minimum monthly IBR payment is $50, not $0. Instead of accumulating interest, you’ll be making small progress towards paying off your debt and increasing your credit rating.
- We only offer one straightforward IBR plan. The federal government has several which all work slightly differently.

Annual IBR repayment amount is 15% of the difference between your Adjusted Gross Income and 150% of the Department of Health and Human Services poverty guideline for your family size and state. This amount is then divided by 12 to get the monthly IBR payment amount. Income-Based Repayment is based on the adjusted gross income during the prior tax year.  IBR Minimum monthly payment is $50 per month.

                When does interest accrue?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Interest will begin to accrue as of the disbursement date on the principal amount of the loan and will continue to accrue on any outstanding balance. Interest will also accrue during periods of non-payment, including periods of authorized deferment. Interest is capitalized upon entering a repayment period status and at the end of any authorized deferment. Basically the same benchmark government loans use.

              <p>
                If you don't pay your full interest amount, that amount can be then transitioned into the total amount you owe to us. We will explain this in more detail when you make a decision that can incur additional costs, and our commitment is to helping you navigate this process with your long-term best interests in mind.
